I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Disease (EEID) group at the University of Oxford.

I'm currently developing a computational and mathematical framework to better understand the transmission and evolution of avian influenza and other multi-strain pathogens along poultry production and distribution systems. More in general, I'm interested in the dynamics and ecology of interacting infectious diseases, with a particular focus on the role of host-related factors in shaping pathogen ecology.
